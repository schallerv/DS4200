00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.480
So when you first open our page, it generates&nbsp;
a lot of text which gives context as to why we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
created this project and some background&nbsp;
to our data and where we obtained it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
So here is our visualization for our user and&nbsp;
it is composed of three parts, with the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.900
part being the main visualization here that&nbsp;
graphs different economic indicators over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.760
Looking at its percent of its maximum value,&nbsp;
and some cool features of our graphs would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.820
a tooltip that gives the instantaneous date&nbsp;
and value of wherever the user wants to look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.360
at. It has these grey bars here which indicate&nbsp;
recessions so this will allow for our user to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.160
the patterns of the different indicators and&nbsp;
how they lead to a recession. And another cool&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.620
feature would be the slider. So let's say our user&nbsp;
wants to take a closer look at the for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.720
the economic recession of 2001. The user can&nbsp;
just select and brush the time frame at what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.660
they want to look at and it updates the main vis&nbsp;
and gives the user a closer look at the visual.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.460
Our next visualization is here on the right&nbsp;
which graphs each indicator individually so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.820
it changes with the dropdown menu and again its&nbsp;
over the same span of years and each indicator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.320
has a different y-value that correlates&nbsp;
with the indicator and how it's measured.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
And when selecting from the dropdown,&nbsp;
not only does it change the graph here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.220
but it changes the text down below which&nbsp;
pretty much tells the user for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.480
what PPI is and how it can lead to a&nbsp;
potential recession. Thank you guys!
