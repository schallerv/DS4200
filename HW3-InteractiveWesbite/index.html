                    <li>this is good mapping because these colors are significantly different from each other and these colors are recognizable to the audience</li>

                    <li>this is good mapping because it provides a spacial significance to how many more votes Clinton would have</li>

                    <li>the classification of each ball (purple-> white-> orange) is a divergent color map due to white being the pivot point with purple representing below average and orange above average</li>
                    <li>one aspect of this colormap that we would change is to change the midpoint color to be slightly more diffentiable from the background (where there is no data)</li>
