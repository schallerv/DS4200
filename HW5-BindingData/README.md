## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to practice creating interactive visualizations with D3.  

## Interactions
   - Scatterplot
      - If the user hovers over a point, that point should highlight.  
      - If the user clicks on a point, that point should be given a border. And the point's coordinates should show in the right column. 
      - If the user clicks on a point that already has a border, the point's border should disappear. 
      - In the right column of your webpage, allow the user to input coordinates for a new point they want to add to the scatterplot. 
   - Bar Chart
      - If the user hovers over a bar, that bar should highlight, and a tooltip should appear that tells the user the bar's values. While it is present, the tooltip should overlay the visualization.
