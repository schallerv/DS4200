## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to practice creating interactive visualizations.  

## Interaction
Scatterplot:

   - If the user hovers over a point, that point should highlight. 
   - If the user clicks on a point, that point should be given a border, and the point's coordinates should show in the right column of the webpage. 
   - If the user clicks on a point that already has a border, the point's border should disappear. 
   - Allow the user to input coordinates for a new point they want to add to the visualization.
